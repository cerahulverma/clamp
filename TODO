==========
Annotate __init__, make an abstract class w/constructor
Set the name of the created interface/abstract class
Set the name of the generated proxy class for Class.forName
If the clamped class extends a Java class and has a clamped __init__, have the generated class extend the Java clas
Assume python class name for non-specified proxy class name
Check for illegal Java method names, illegal subclassing
Ant task to compile all interfaces

After 0.1
=========
Generate Java source for the bytecode to expose docs to Java
Add type checking to internal Python calls to clamped methods so the Python can assume it
