Done
=========
Generate interfaces for Python classes with clamped methods
Generate abstract Java classes for Python classes with a clamped __init__
Set the name of the generated proxy class for Class.forName
Assume python class name for non-specified proxy class name
Allow checked exceptions to be specified
Allow overloaded method signatures with tuples of class types in position
Generate additional method signatures for default arguments in function

Before 0.1
==========
If the clamped class extends a Java class and has a clamped __init__, have the generated class extend the Java class
Handle array arguments
Set the name of the created interface
Version Jython proxy files
Check for illegal Java method names, illegal subclassing
Ant task to compile all interfaces
jarjar with same asm settings as Jython

After 0.1
=========
Generate Java source for the bytecode to expose docs to Java
Add type checking to internal Python calls to clamped methods so the Python can assume it
Make easy to use from guice, spring, hadoop
